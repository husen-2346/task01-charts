# Task 01 – Population Distribution Visualization

This project is a simple data visualization task that demonstrates how to analyze and display the distribution of **categorical** and **continuous** variables using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

## Objective

Create visualizations such as **bar charts** and **histograms** to represent:
- **Categorical data** (e.g., Gender)
- **Continuous data** (e.g., Age)

This project was developed as part of **SkillCraft Technology – Data Science Internship Task 01**.

---

## Visualizations Included

1. **Histogram – Age Distribution**
   - Shows the frequency of age groups in a population
   - Ideal for continuous numeric data

2. **Bar Chart – Gender Distribution**
   - Represents the count of individuals by gender
   - Ideal for categorical data

---

## Dataset

A sample dataset is used containing:
- `Age`: Continuous variable (randomized for demo)
- `Gender`: Categorical variable with values like Male, Female, etc.

You can replace the sample data with your own CSV file.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib** for visualization

---
